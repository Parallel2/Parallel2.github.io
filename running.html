    <p>
        Running is something that I have been very invested in for many years now. I started running competitively since
        7th grade when I first started cross country. Over the years I have learned to love cross country more and more,
        even to the point where I would like to continue my career in college. Running is a big part of my life and I am
        glad to be a part of the Firebird Cross Country team, and to be a runner in general.
