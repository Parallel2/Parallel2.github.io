        <h1>Me</h1>
        <img class="Prom2022" src="images/Prom.2022.jpeg" />
        <p>My name is Jack Otten, and I&apos;m a 17-year-old senior in high school, dedicated to both my academics and
            extracurricular activities. I proudly maintain straight A&apos;s while balancing a rigorous schedule of CCP,
            AP,
            and college classes. As the captain of my cross country team and a leader in track, I take pride in
            inspiring my teammates and fostering a sense of camaraderie. My commitment to excellence extends beyond
            sports; I consistently strive to do my best in all areas of my life, whether it&apos;s studying for exams or
            pushing through challenges on the field.</p>

        <h2>Beliefs</h2>
        <img class="FallRetreat" src="images/Fall-Retreat.jpeg" />
        <p class="p2">Outside of school, I find great joy in my involvement with the student ministry at my church,
            where I teach
            children about God and engage them in meaningful discussions. This experience has deepened my passion for
            education and sharing my faith, and I envision a future where I can continue to guide and inspire others,
            either as a full-time career or a rewarding side pursuit. I go to church every Sunday night where I can talk
            about God with friends and deeper understand my faith and live through holy friendships. I have a close-knit
            group of friends with whom I enjoy spending my limited free time with. Whether we&apos;re hanging out in
            person
            or diving into our favorite video games, I love spending time and having fun with them.</p>

        <h3>Technology</h3>
        <img class="PC" src="images/MYPC.jpeg" />
        <p>In my free time, I dive into the world of technology, whether it&apos;s gaming, building PCs, or staying
            updated
            on the latest advancements. I play a variety of games on my PC, like Fortnite, Rocket League, Minecraft,
            Roblox, Overwatch, and many others. I also enjoy coding and web development; I&apos;ve even created a few
            games
            like Coconut Collector and Rock Clicker (a spin on Cookie Clicker). My passion for technology runs deep, and
            as I head to college next year, I&apos;m excited to keep learning, experimenting, and exploring this field.
